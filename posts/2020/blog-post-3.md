<!-- Excerpt Start -->LoremThis will output the the post title and date
<!-- Excerpt End --> for each post. This layout template itself uses base-layout.njk layout, so it’s a nested layout template. To use this layout template, update the front matter metadata in each blog post Markdown file to layout: post-layout.njk.

Congratulations, you’ve got yourself a blog setup where adding new posts and having the homepage update is as simple as creating a new Markdown file.
